      <description>The container ecosystem is moving rapidly. A lot happened in 2019! It seems the container ecosystem has arrived at the &amp;ldquo;consolidation&amp;rdquo; stage of the hype cycle:
 Docker Inc. sold off its enterprise business and had a bunch of restructuring. They shelved Docker Swarm saying &amp;ldquo;The primary orchestrator going forward is Kubernetes.&amp;rdquo; Twitter joined Spotify in moving away from Mesos-based container orchestration to Kubernetes. This was a huge blow to Mesos given Twitter was its original developer.</description>

      <description>Wifi problems So, I&#39;m having a problem with my laptop. When I&#39;m using the “TelenetWiFree” connection, I get disconnected after a certain amount of time, and for some reason I cannot reconnect until I restart my computer. Toggling the hardware Wifi kill-switch, which lets you disable and enable the power to the wifi hardware, does not resolve the problem. After re-enabling the hardware, the wifi doesn&#39;t seem to come back again.</description>

      <description>I got a ticket to the Pragmatic Docker Day meetup in Ghent in exchange for writing a blogpost about it. Free food, drinks &amp;amp; awesome talks for a whole day, who would want to miss that? Not me!
So here are my unstructured thoughts I gathered from the meetup:
Docker is awesome! What is docker? Docker encapsulates apps in their own little sandbox. Every app runs in its own container. An environment made especially so the app can run well and can&#39;t mess to much with other apps running on the same server.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s rid the world of one of the most prominent Linux myths: “Desktop Linux sucks. It&#39;s just not there yet”.
When Windows power users try out Linux two things always happen:
 They get frustrated because they can&#39;t find how to do something in Linux. They brick their system, or make it extremely buggy.  I&#39;ve been that person, I&#39;ve bricked my system (a lot!), and the fact is, it was entirely my own fault.</description>
