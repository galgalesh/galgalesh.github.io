      <description>Note: This article talks about Snaps and Flatpaks. This is the software behind two universal Linux app stores: the Snap Store and Flathub. If you are not familiar with these, please first read The future of Linux desktop application delivery is Flatpak and Snap.
 Snaps and Flatpaks are often compared to each other because they both make it super easy for Linux users to get the latest versions of desktop applications.</description>

      <description>S4A, or Scratch for Arduino, is an app that you can use to program Arduino boards using Scratch. You can program robots and LED&amp;rsquo;s without writing any code: all you need to do is drag and drop instructions in the visual programming environment.
Step 1: Install Arduino IDE and S4A The first step is to install Arduino and S4A from the Snap Store.
sudo snap install arduino s4a After that, you need to give the user account on your computer access to USB devices.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s up with CRI-O, Kata Containers and Podman?</title>

      <description>The container ecosystem is moving rapidly. A lot happened in 2019! It seems the container ecosystem has arrived at the &amp;ldquo;consolidation&amp;rdquo; stage of the hype cycle:
 Docker Inc. sold off its enterprise business and had a bunch of restructuring. They shelved Docker Swarm saying &amp;ldquo;The primary orchestrator going forward is Kubernetes.&amp;rdquo; Twitter joined Spotify in moving away from Mesos-based container orchestration to Kubernetes. This was a huge blow to Mesos given Twitter was its original developer.</description>

      <description>Close Encounters of the Third Kind &amp;ldquo;We really need to do something about the valve. We&amp;rsquo;ve passed the point where we can wait two more years to see how it progresses.&amp;rdquo;
I was silent for a while, so the cardiologist asked &amp;ldquo;do you understand what I mean?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Like, I need a transplant from a pig heart?&amp;rdquo;, I asked.
&amp;ldquo;Well, given your age an artificial valve is more likely.&amp;rdquo;
It was clear my heart was fucked.</description>

      <title>Who owns my research?</title>

      <description>When I submitted my first paper, I realized I had no idea who owned my research! Was I authorized to transfer the rights to a journal or did I need someone else&amp;rsquo;s permission? After some digging, I found the answer and wrote it all up in a neat little document. So here&amp;rsquo;s the dusted off version, in case it&amp;rsquo;s useful to anyone else.
In short Intellectual property (IP) as a PhD student at Ghent University is largely divided into two parts: research results and educational material.</description>

      <description>Wifi problems So, I&amp;rsquo;m having a problem with my laptop. When I&amp;rsquo;m using the “TelenetWiFree” connection, I get disconnected after a certain amount of time, and for some reason I cannot reconnect until I restart my computer. Toggling the hardware Wifi kill-switch, which lets you disable and enable the power to the wifi hardware, does not resolve the problem. After re-enabling the hardware, the wifi doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to come back again.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic Docker Day 2015</title>

      <description>I got a ticket to the Pragmatic Docker Day meetup in Ghent in exchange for writing a blogpost about it. Free food, drinks &amp;amp; awesome talks for a whole day, who would want to miss that? Not me!
So here are my unstructured thoughts I gathered from the meetup:
Docker is awesome! What is docker? Docker encapsulates apps in their own little sandbox. Every app runs in its own container. An environment made especially so the app can run well and can&amp;rsquo;t mess to much with other apps running on the same server.</description>

      <title>Windows power users are not Linux power users!</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s rid the world of one of the most prominent Linux myths: “Desktop Linux sucks. It&amp;rsquo;s just not there yet”.
When Windows power users try out Linux two things always happen:
 They get frustrated because they can&amp;rsquo;t find how to do something in Linux. They brick their system, or make it extremely buggy.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been that person, I&amp;rsquo;ve bricked my system (a lot!), and the fact is, it was entirely my own fault.</description>

      <description>Automatically build snap packages The easiest way to automatically build snaps is build.snapcraft.io. However, this tool is very limited: it only supports GitHub as a source and it always builds snaps from master.
When your needs are a bit more advanced, you can use the Launchpad build service to set up automatic builds. This method is highly customizeable.
