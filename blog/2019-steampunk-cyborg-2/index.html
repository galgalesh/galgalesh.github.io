    <h2 id="we-can-rebuild-him">We can rebuild him</h2>
<p>When I woke up, the first thing I saw were my parents, talking to a nurse. My parents wanted to leave but the nurse asked them to stay. She said it's better to have familiar faces there when I woke up. I tried to say I agreed, but I wasn't able to produce any sound so I just closed my eyes for a bit and waited until I was a bit more awake.</p>
<p>What felt like minutes of drifting in and out of conciousness were actually hours according to my parent's accounts. I felt incredibly hot and wanted to get my feet from under the blanket, but I still hadn't figured out how to produce sound, so I had to use my 10 ton limbs to try to fix the issue. The mumification-grade blanket wrap around my legs that is so typical for hospital beds wasn't coming loose by my wiggling toes, so I tried to get use my hands to pull up the blanket. This attempt was quickly stopped by my parents, however, who told me to hold my arms still because my arms were still connected to a dozen tubes. I wasn't about to give up though since by this point my feet felt as if they could melt any moment. Having got my parents attention, I could now use my hands to ask my parents to help my feet escape their personal sauna. Success! After some frantic pointing they finally understood me and released my feet.</p>
<p>By this point, I figured out that the reason why I couldn't produce any sound was because I was still intubated. This was annoying because nobody thought about informing me about how the surgery went. Did everything go well? Did I become a cyborg? Before the surgery, the surgeon informed me that there was a small chance she might still be able to fix the existing valve instead of having to replace it completely. So, was she able to do this? Luckily, the nurse extubated me soon after, allowing me to finally pop the question &ldquo;So, how did it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?! Everything went well. She wasn't able to fix the original valve, but they put in an artificial one and it's working correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking was still difficult for me because I simply couldn't get enough air in my lungs to say a full sentence. I told my parents I was seeing the biggest aura I had ever seen. The nurse gave me a weird look so I explained &ldquo;Like when I'm getting a migraine&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(symptom)">aura</a> normally looks like for me. I see this weird flashing shape before I get a migraine attack. It starts with a tiny spot and grows into a big spiral. The headache itself starts a few minutes after the aura disappears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire top part of my vision was flickering like this for the first few hours, but I've learned to ignore it so it didn't bother me that much. After my parents left the first night started and it was actually a relatively pleasant experience thanks to the nurse who was with me the entire night. I wasn't able to sleep much, partly because every time I fell asleep I seemed to stop breathing and woke back up gasping for air. During the surgery they gave me medication to stop my breathing reflex, and it seemed like it wasn't completely flushed yet. However, the nurse was able to comfort me by explaining that I had multiple sensors checking the oxygen level in my blood and she constantly adjusted the extra oxygen I got based on those values. We talked a lot throughout the first night, which mostly consisted of me asking what every single tube and machine was doing and her explaining everything.</p>
<p>The pain the first night was relatively ok. The nurse used a whole bunch of pillows to put my upper body in a position that hurt the least, which helped a lot, and the anesthesia was still very much in my body. As the night progressed, the pain got worse, but the nurse kept increasing the painkillers to keep it under control. Even though the pain was under control, I felt as if lying in that bed was one of the most difficult things I've ever done in my life. The simple act of breathing, for example, required a lot of effort. Given my ribs were just cut open, I had to focus on using my stomach to breathe instead of my chest and I had to fight the pain every time I inhaled. Not breathing would have been a much less painful option but most doctors recommend against that given the body's reliance on breathing to acquire oxygen and dispose of carbon dioxide. Having to spend so much energy to do something so vital was a very weird experience. As a seemingly healthy 27-year old, I've never been confronted with the fact that your body can fail to the simple things required to keep you alive. Even with all this, I still felt as if I could take it, I still had some fight left in me. I was even making some jokes like how my childhood dream of becoming a ninja is now shattered because people will be able to hear my new valve tick when I sneak up to them.</p>
<p>My mood quickly changed in the morning, however. There is a limit to how much painkillers they can pump through your body. Moreover, because we believed I was allergic to one of the painkillers, the options were even more limited for me. So we reached a point where they couldn't increase the dosage to match my pain level anymore. On top of that, the morning brought in the morning crew, who were surprisingly successful in maintaining a noise level of &ldquo;London Underground during rush hour&rdquo;. The nurse apologized for the noise and explained that they wanted to move me from the ICU to mid-care, which is a lot more quieter. My blood pressure, however, was too high to leave the ICU. Given the stampede of interns running through the ICU, the only way to get my blood pressure down was to give me a pill.</p>
<p>This pill came with only one side effect: me puking my guts out. An attentive reader might wonder at this point &ldquo;isn't it very painful to puke your guts out when any chest movement causes shooting pain?&rdquo;
Good question, attentive reader! This is indeed <em>extremely</em> painful. Furthermore, the relieved feeling you normally get after puking was absent. My body couldn't even pretend like what just happened was useful. Any bit of fight left in my body quickly disappeared. Or in better terms: any bit of fight left in my consciousness quickly disappeared because to my own surprise, my body body and mind just kept going even without my support. The orchestra continued playing even though the conductor gave up. I discovered a new autopilot.</p>
<p>The first weeks I got multiple aura's a day and this slowly reduced over the next weeks and months following my surgery. The doctors initially thought this might be due to the anesthesia they gave me, but that shouldn't affect me months after the surgery. M</p>
