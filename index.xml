      <description>Wifi problems So, I&amp;rsquo;m having a problem with my laptop. When I&amp;rsquo;m using the &amp;#8220;TelenetWiFree&amp;#8221; connection, I get disconnected after a certain amount of time, and for some reason I cannot reconnect until I restart my computer. Toggling the hardware Wifi kill-switch, which lets you disable and enable the power to the wifi hardware, does not resolve the problem. After re-enabling the hardware, the wifi doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to come back again.</description>

      <description>I got a ticket to the Pragmatic Docker Day meetup in Ghent in exchange for writing a blogpost about it. Free food, drinks &amp;amp; awesome talks for a whole day, who would want to miss that? Not me!
So here are my unstructured thoughts I gathered from the meetup:
Docker is awesome! What is docker? Docker encapsulates apps in their own little sandbox. Every app runs in its own container.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s rid the world of one of the most prominent Linux myths: &amp;#8220;Desktop Linux sucks. It&amp;rsquo;s just not there yet&amp;#8221;.
When Windows power users try out Linux two things always happen:
 They get frustrated because they can&amp;rsquo;t find how to do something in Linux. They brick their system, or make it extremely buggy.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been that person, I&amp;rsquo;ve bricked my system (a lot!), and the fact is, it was entirely my own fault.</description>
